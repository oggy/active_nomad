# Active Nomad

ActiveRecord objects with a customizable persistence strategy.

## Why

Sometimes you want an Active Record object that does not live in the database.
Perhaps it never needs to be persisted, or you'd like to store it in a cookie,
or a key-value store, but it would still be handy to have ActiveRecord's ability
to cast values, run validations, or fire callbacks.

If only the persistence strategy was pluggable...

## How

Subclass from ActiveNomad::Base and declare your attributes with the `attribute`
class method. The arguments look just like creating a column in a migration:

    class Thing < ActiveNomad::Base
      attribute :name, :string, :limit => 20
    end

To persist the record, Active Nomad calls `persist`, which calls a
Proc registered by `to_save`. For example, here's how you could
persist to a cookie:

    thing = Thing.from_json(cookies[:thing])
    thing.to_save do |thing|
      cookies[:thing] = thing.to_ordered_json
      true
    end

Things to note:

 * The proc should return true if persistence was successful, false
   otherwise. This will be the return value of `save`, etc.
 * Active Nomad defines `to_ordered_json` and `from_json` which will serialize
   to and from a JSON string with predictable attribute order (i.e., appropriate
   for a cookie).
 * You may alternatively override `persist` in a subclass if you don't want to
   register a proc for every instance.

### Serialization formats

Active Nomad provides serialization to and from:

 * JSON (`to_ordered_json` and `from_json`)
 * Query string (`to_ordered_query_string` and `from_query_string`)

You can define your own formats easily using `to_serialized_attributes` and
`from_serialized_attributes`. The former returns an `ActiveSupport::OrderedHash`
of attribute names to serialized values (`String`s or `nil`s).

### Transactions

In addition to customizing persistence, you can also customize transaction
semantics by overriding the `transaction` class method in a base class. Here's
an example that implements transactions with Redis:

    class RedisNomad < ActiveNomad::Base
      def self.transaction
        redis.multi
        begin
          yield
          redis.exec
        rescue Exception => e
          redis.discard
          raise
        end
      end

      def self.redis
        @redis ||= Redis.new
      end
    end

`ActiveNomad::Base.transaction` simply calls the given block with no real
transaction semantics.

## Notes

Only ActiveRecord 2.3 compatible. ActiveRecord 3.0 has a more modular
architecture which makes this largely unnecessary.
